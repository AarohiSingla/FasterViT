# Overview

Via Laurence Maroney:
> Rock Paper Scissors contains images from a variety of different hands,  from different races, ages and genders, posed into Rock / Paper or Scissors and labelled as such. You can download the training set here, and the test set here. These images have all been generated using CGI techniques as an experiment in determining if a CGI-based dataset can be used for classification against real images. I also generated a few images that you can use for predictions. You can find them here.

Note that all of this data is posed against a white background.

Each image is 300Ã—300 pixels in 24-bit color.

There are 2520 examples examples in the trianing set, 840 per class. The validation set contains 372 examples (124 per class). The test set contains 9 unlabeled images per class. (Note: in the source, Laurence calls "validation" as the "test," and "test" the "validation.")
